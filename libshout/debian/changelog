      noticing the newer release, and to Ying-Chun Liu
      <grandpaul@gmail.com> for tracking the memory leak bug).

    magically makes qa.debian.org work again, or it perhaps needs a
    simpler regex.)

  * Update local cdbs snippet copyright-check.mk:
    + Make egrep options configurable.
    + Ignore auto-tools files.

    + src/htpp/ and src/timing/ (LGPL)

    Jochens <aj@andaco.de> and Roland Stigge <stigge@antcom.de> for
    reporting, and to Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org> for
